---

Git AI's behavior can be configured on developer machines by writing a JSON file in the user's home directory.

On Linux and macOS, this file is located at `$HOME/.git-ai/config.json`.
On Windows, this file is located at `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\config.json`.

## Configuration Options

All options in `config.json` are optional and will fall back to default values if not provided.

| Option | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `git_path` | `Path` | The path to the (unaltered) `git` binary you distribute on developer machines | Whichever git is on the shell path |
| `prompt_storage` | `"default" \| "notes" \| "local"` | Controls where prompt data is stored. `default` = local/enterprise, `notes` = include in git notes, `local` = local SQLite only | `"default"` |
| `exclude_prompts_in_repositories` | `Pattern[]` | Exclude prompts from authorship logs for repositories matching these patterns. Supports glob patterns (e.g., `https://github.com/myorg/*`). Use `"*"` to exclude all. | Empty list (no exclusions) |
| `allow_repositories` | `Pattern[]` | Allow `git-ai` in only these remotes. Supports glob patterns (e.g., `https://github.com/myorg/*`) | If not specified or set to an empty list, all repositories are allowed |
| `exclude_repositories` | `Pattern[]` | Exclude `git-ai` from these remotes. Supports glob patterns (e.g., `https://github.com/myorg/*`) | If a repository is present in both allow and exclude lists, exclusion takes precedence |
| `telemetry_oss` | `"off"` | Disable OSS performance metrics and error logging sent to Git AI maintainers | Defaults to enabled |
| `telemetry_enterprise_dsn` | `string` | A Sentry DSN to use to send yourself performance metrics and error logging | Defaults to none |
| `disable_version_checks` | `boolean` | Skip automated version checks that would otherwise run on fetch/pull/push | `false` |
| `disable_auto_updates` | `boolean` | Keep checking for updates but never install them automatically | `false` |
| `update_channel` | `"latest" \| "next"` | Release channel to follow (`latest` = stable, `next` = prerelease) | `"latest"` |

## Example Configuration

```json
{
    "git_path": "/usr/bin/git",
    "exclude_prompts_in_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/internal/private-repo.git",
        "https://github.com/private-org/**"
    ],
    "allow_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai.git"
    ],
    "exclude_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/internal/private-repo.git"
    ],
    "disable_version_checks": false,
    "disable_auto_updates": false,
    "update_channel": "latest"
}
```

## Update Controls

Most enterprises roll out new binaries gradually. Combine these three options to match your rollout plan:

- `update_channel` selects which release feed each machine follows. Use `next` for early adopters and keep the rest of the org on `latest`.
- `disable_version_checks` completely skips the asynchronous checks that normally run on fetch/pull/push. Only use this if you manage upgrades manually.
- `disable_auto_updates` keeps those checks but stops the background installer, so the CLI only surfaces a "run git-ai upgrade" message.

Because the config file lives in each user's home directory, you can templatize these fields through MDM, your endpoint management tool, or any bootstrap script.

## Configuration Use Cases

### Limiting to Specific Repositories

Use `allow_repositories` to enable Git AI only for approved repositories. You can use exact URLs or glob patterns:

```json
{
    "allow_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/yourorg/product-repo.git",
        "https://github.com/yourorg/mobile-app.git",
        "https://github.com/yourorg/*"
    ]
}
```

The glob pattern `https://github.com/yourorg/*` will match all repositories under your organization.

### Excluding Sensitive Repositories

Use `exclude_repositories` to prevent Git AI from tracking specific repositories. Glob patterns make it easy to exclude entire categories:

```json
{
    "exclude_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/yourorg/**",
        "**/org/**",
    ]
}
```

Glob patterns like `https://github.com/*/private-*` will match any repository starting with "private-" from any organization, and `*secret*` will match any remote URL containing the word "secret".

## Glob Pattern Support

The `exclude_prompts_in_repositories`, `allow_repositories`, and `exclude_repositories` fields all support glob patterns for flexible repository matching:

- `*` matches any sequence of characters within a path segment
- `?` matches any single character
- `[abc]` matches any character in the brackets
- `[!abc]` matches any character not in the brackets

### Common Glob Pattern Examples

```json
{
    "exclude_prompts_in_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/myorg/private-*",   // Exclude prompts from private repos
        "https://github.com/internal/*"          // Exclude prompts from internal org
    ],
    "allow_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/myorg/*",           // All repos in myorg
        "https://github.com/*/public-*",        // Any repo starting with public-
        "*@github.com:company/*",               // SSH remotes for company org
        "https://*.internal.com/*"              // Any internal domain repos
    ],
    "exclude_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/*/test-*",          // Any test repositories
        "*.internal.private.com/*"              // Specific internal domain
    ]
}
```

**Note:** Exact URLs still work as before and are treated as literal patterns (no wildcards needed).

### Prompt Storage Modes

By default, Git AI stores prompt data **locally only** in a SQLite database. Prompts are not included in git notes.

To include prompts in authorship logs (git notes), set `prompt_storage` to `notes`:

```json
{
    "prompt_storage": "notes"
}
```

When clients are configured for Git AI enterprise, notes are securely uploaded to your Git AI enterprise instance.

### Excluding Prompts from Specific Repositories

You can exclude specific repositories from having prompt data included in authorship logs by using `exclude_prompts_in_repositories`:

```json
{
    "prompt_storage": "notes",
    "exclude_prompts_in_repositories": ["*"]
}
```

To exclude prompts only from specific private repositories:

```json
{
    "prompt_storage": "notes",
    "exclude_prompts_in_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/myorg/private-repo.git",
        "https://github.com/myorg/internal-*"
    ]
}
```


## Telemetry for Custom Forks

If you build `git-ai` from source you can set your Sentry-compatible DSN at build time instead of using the `config.json` file.

```
SENTRY_ENTERPRISE="https://enterprise-key@o0.ingest.sentry.io/456" \
cargo build --release
```
